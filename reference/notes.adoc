Nov, 2018
    For those of you who have asked or didn't know about this yet, I'd like to share our plans to release a 3scale Istio Mixer Adapter in H1 2019. More details below.

    The 3scale Istio Mixer Adapter will extend API management capabilities (developer access via developer portal and documentation, access control and plans, usage analytics, billing and invoicing) to services exposed within the service mesh. Instead of APIcast being the traffic manager agent, the control point will be Envoy sidecars (deployed with each service) which go through the adapter to perform policy checks against the 3scale API Manager.

    The 3scale Istio Mixer Adapter is going to be bundled with Red Hat's Service Mesh, which will be part of OpenShift and will come at no additional cost.

    More details about background, functionality trade-offs of using APIcast or Envoy sidecars, deployment, what policies will be configured where, etc. can be found in this internal slide deck (it's work in progress, feedback welcome!).[1]

    Meanwhile, if you have any customers potentially interested in getting early access to the adapter, please add them to the list here [2]. At this stage we will heavily prioritize customers who can provide valuable feedback based on a good understanding of their use cases for Service Mesh and API Management. Ideally they will already be a user of either 3scale or Istio.

APIcast gets full mTLS that can be viwed in the itio observability tools

Will also respect destination rules defined by istio

This is project lacks some documentation, I will work on that soon, but basically allows to use 3scale as a decision engine inside Istio, without using APIcast.

We absolutely want Istio to be able to play in this space, both as a standalone project and as the datapath for existing commercial API management solutions.

Istio can already validate JWTs and enforce basic rate limiting.  See docs here and here.

Those are fine for some use cases (not many unique clients), but you may want to have a system that isn't dependent on CRDs for clients or individual rate limits. 
To show that, we've released a Mixer adapter that is an integration with our Apigee Edge enterprise API management product. 
This allows you to use Apigee for, for example, creation of API keys or client IDs (Apigee has a portal in which your customers can create their own credentials self-service) and rate limits. 
Istio can then enforce the policies defined in the api management system by way of a Mixer adapter.

== Guidance from Mark Cheshire

. Red Hat will be at the forefront of integrating Istio into the container platfrom (OpenShift) as well as with API Management (3scale)

. 3scale has always had the same architectural approach as Istio - to separate the control plane from the data plane - which will lead to better integration.

. Competitors without the separation of gateway and management server or who are focused primarily on the gateway will likely not coexist well

. Istio is primarily focused on advanced traffic management

. 3scale is primarily focused the end-to-end experience of how to open, control, and manage APIs (including Microservices) - authorization, access policies, developer management, developer portal and docs

. The main overlapping area right now is analytics - 3scale is focused more on the app managers and API architectures, while Istio is focused more on developers and dev ops

. In future there will be more overlapping areas, and we will see a similar bifurcation of views. Different companies will have different preferences.

. Bottom line we aim to be the best company at integrating traditional API Management with Service Mesh environments though a whole-hearted embrace of Istio.
